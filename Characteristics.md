  # Characteristics about Node.js <h1>

  
  
   ## Advantages of using Node.js <h2>
  >The main characteristic of Node.JS was created in 2009
  >to meet a market need. It is the fact that its execution 
  >is single-threaded. That is, only one thread is 
  >responsible for executing the Javascript code of the application, 
  >while in other languages the execution is multi-thread. Like PHP, Java, C#.
  
   ## Flexibility <h2>
  >NPM (Node Package Manager) is the package manager for Node.js and is also the
  >largest software repository in the world. This makes Node.js a platform with
  >the potential to be used in any situation. The best known package is called 
  >Express.js and is a complete framework for web application development."
  
   ## Lightness <h2>
  >Creating a Node.js environment and uploading an application is a task that
  >does not require a lot of computing resources in comparison with other more 
  >traditional technologies. If used in conjunction with tools like Docker, the
  >vgain in deployment speed and machine replication can be very significant and
  >in scalable environments this means less cost and more efficiency.

  >Both its lightness and flexibility make Node.JS a suitable technology for the
  >implementation of services and components in architectures such as microservices
  >and serveless.  In addition, it is supported by the main Cloud products and services 
  >companies in the market, such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which offer
  >native support for Node.JS in most of their products.
  
   ## Team Productivity <h2>
  >World's largest repository: NPM provides reusable code packages and probably that 
  >integration you need to make with another system or database is already implemented 
  >and available for free to install via NPM.

  >Same language on the frontend and backend: Javascript is the standard language for
  >client-side web development. Web development companies count this know-how as an
  >important starting point to start using Node.ls. Moreover, this factor can represent 
  >gains in code reuse and the creation of multidisciplinary teams, with better resource
  >utilization.

  >Innovation environment: Possibility of faster deploys and iterations and On the Fly
  >problem solving. This also allows the creation of own and innovative solutions,
  >as Uber has done by creating products in Node.js to solve some of its problems.
