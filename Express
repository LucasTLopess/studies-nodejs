It seems that the first step in learning Node.JS would be to learn what Express is.

So I read in the course {https://web.digitalinnovation.one/course/introducao-ao-nodejs-com-expresses}

That Express is a minimalistic and fast web framework for Node.js that provides a robust framework and 
feature set for web and mobile applications.

It features HTTP utility methods and middleware to create a fast and secure API. So it is very useful
in API and microservices development which is what I am currently studying both in college and at work.
 
 
To start using Express in your project just type the following code

"npm install express --save
 
 Simple as that, you can now upload an application to any port on your LocalHost.
 
 Example : 
 
        ```javascript
        const express = require('express')
        const app = express()
        const port = 3000

        app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Node running express!'))

        app.listen(port, () => console.log('application running on port 3000'))
        ```

Check: 

``` http://localhost:3000/ ```

Basically this was my first contact with Node.js using the Express framework.


    function test() {
      console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
    }




```
Este é um bloco de código.
