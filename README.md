# Studies Node.js
Compilation of Node.JS Studies

We are at the end of the first half of the year 2021.

I'm going to do a brece study on Node.JS.

#PAYPAL
The digital wallet company PAYPAL reported the following using Node.JS to build their applications:

->The applications were written(developed) twice as fast and with fewer people on the team.

->Wrote 33% fewer lines of code and shrunk files by 40%.

->Supported twice as many requests per second and server response time decreased by 35%.


# But why would a company the size of PAYPAL choose to use Node.js to develop its application?

This is because Node.js can be defined as a server-side JavaScript execution environment.

The main reason for its adoption is its high scalability; In addition its architecture, flexibility and low cost make it a good choice for implementing Microservices and Serveless architecture components.

An interesting thing to mention is also that the main cloud services already support development using Node.JS.
